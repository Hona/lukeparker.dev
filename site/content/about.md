I began learning how to code when I was 10, making little console apps. This ultimately lead me to learning about all different types of development, like web development, backend development, CLI tools, and many more.

I have recently been loving to work with Docker (and `docker-compose`), making my hosting process a single command.

I love to develop freelance projects (if you are interested, feel free to [contact me](/contact)), as well as open-source projects; allowing me to help others, by using it as a learning tool from the source or by actually using the apps.

### Design Pattern and Architecture Interests

I have been recently getting into using DDD (domain driven design), using MediatR, AutoMapper and MartenDB.
