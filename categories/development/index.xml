NuGet Using your package manager, add a reference to the latest version of AntDesign in the project OKR.Web
Blazor Boilerplate Now with the package installed, we have to reference the assets and add a few modules to the dependency injection.
Add to OKR.Web/Pages/_Host.cshtml, just before the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; tag closes:</description></item><item><title>Building a Beautiful OKR with AntBlazor - Part 2</title><link>https://www.lukeparker.dev/posts/building-a-beautiful-okr-with-antblazor/2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.lukeparker.dev/posts/building-a-beautiful-okr-with-antblazor/2/</guid><description>Planning the Backend There is one objective with many key results. I added some properties that I think will be useful. These may change as we figure out the UI/UX a bit more.
Some feature ideas:
Objectives should be toggleable if they are active or not Objectives should have a start and end date Objectives should have a brief title, and a longer description Key Results should have a brief title, and a longer description Key Results should be toggleable if they are active or not Key Results should have a completion percent 0%-100% Key Results should have a priority (higher the number the more important) public class Objective { public Guid Id { get; set; } public string Title { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } public DateTime DueDate { get; set; } public DateTime StartDate { get; set; } public bool Active { get; set; } } public class KeyResult { public Guid Id { get; set; } public Guid ObjectiveId { get; set; } public string Title { get; set; } public string Description { get; set; } public bool Active { get; set; } public decimal Completion { get; set; } public int Priority { get; set; } } That&amp;rsquo;s it for the core models!</description></item><item><title>Building a Beautiful OKR with AntBlazor - Part 1</title><link>https://www.lukeparker.dev/posts/building-a-beautiful-okr-with-antblazor/1/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.lukeparker.dev/posts/building-a-beautiful-okr-with-antblazor/1/</guid><description>Boilerplate GitHub Create a repository called OKR, and initialize it with only a README.md file Open GitHub Desktop, and clone the repository to your machine Folder Structure The physical folder structure will be:
OKR │ README.md │ Docker Related files | .sln │ ... | └───src │ └─── ... (Projects e.g. &amp;#39;OKR.Web&amp;#39;) │ .csproj │ Dockerfile │ ... Setup Solution + Projects Open the folder in the file explorer, and Shift + Right Click -&amp;gt; Open PowerShell window here.</description></item><item><title>Building a Beautiful OKR with AntBlazor - Part 0</title><link>https://www.lukeparker.dev/posts/building-a-beautiful-okr-with-antblazor/0/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.lukeparker.dev/posts/building-a-beautiful-okr-with-antblazor/0/</guid><description>Introduction Why? There are many boilerplate Blazor examples everywhere online, showing the basics, and some more intricate parts. However, I am yet to find a full blog series showing end-to-end, how to make a beautiful UI and clean coded backend &amp;lsquo;real world&amp;rsquo; website with Blazor
The Idea For this series I decided that a reasonably simple but more complex than the typical TODO app, is an OKR website. If you aren&amp;rsquo;t familiar with what an OKR tracker is, it stands for objectives and key results.</description></item><item><title>Why I switched to Rider from Visual Studio for C# Development</title><link>https://www.lukeparker.dev/posts/why-i-switched-to-rider-from-vs-for-csharp-development/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.lukeparker.dev/posts/why-i-switched-to-rider-from-vs-for-csharp-development/</guid><description>Context I have personally been using Visual Studio since I started learning to code, all the way back in 2010 using VB.NET. Over that time I have grown more comfortable with using the IDE. Made by Microsoft, and considered the flagship way to develop for C#, why would I want to switch away from it?
Visual Studio&amp;rsquo;s Shortcomings Very laggy - Visual Studio as a piece of software is an age-old behemoth, an unavoidable recipe for lag, and severe slow downs.</description></item></channel></rss>
